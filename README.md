An OCR system that can takes handwritten Hindi words as input and recognises them.

The model was trained on the **Devanagri Character Dataset** and a Deep Learning based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was used.

Numpy and OpenCV was used to preprocess the image, find the region of interest (ROI) etc. before passing it to the model for the final prediction.
